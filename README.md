# Mirabilis AI

Version: 26.3R1-S3
Owner and Builder: Moshiko Nayman

Mirabilis AI is a local-first assistant app with a Next.js frontend, Express backend, and optional local inference engines.

## Quick Start

```bash
./install.sh
./run.sh
```

Open: http://localhost:3000

`./run.sh` starts Mirabilis and launches all available local providers for direct switching from the UI.

## Canonical Providers

- `ollama`
- `openai-compatible` (backed by local `llama-server`)
- `koboldcpp`

Run modes:

```bash
./run.sh                  # UI mode (auto-start local providers)
./run.sh ollama
./run.sh openai-compatible
./run.sh koboldcpp
./run.sh stop
```

## CPU / Core Usage

For `openai-compatible` and `koboldcpp`, Mirabilis uses all logical CPU cores by default.

Override thread count:

```bash
MIRABILIS_THREADS=8 ./run.sh openai-compatible
MIRABILIS_THREADS=8 ./run.sh koboldcpp
```

## MSQ Model Family

MSQ is the native Mirabilis model family built on top of publicly available base models and tuned for use with this app.

| Model | Base | Params | Context | Character |
|-------|------|--------|---------|---|
| **MSQ-Lite-4B** | gemma3 (3.3 GB) | 4B | 8 192 | Fast, direct, minimal. Daily driver. |
| **MSQ-Pro-12B** | gemma3:12b (8.1 GB) | 12B | 32 768 | Thorough, deep reasoning. No ceiling. |
| **MSQ-Raw-8B** | dolphin3 (4.9 GB) | 8B | 8 192 | Fully unrestricted. No safety filters. |

### Setup

Requires Ollama. Run once to create all three models:

```bash
bash training/msq/setup.sh
```

Models will appear in the **MSQ** group at the top of the model selector after setup.

> **MSQ-Raw-8B** disables all content filters. Use responsibly and only on hardware you control.

## Notes

- Provider names are canonical and consistent across launcher, backend, and UI.
- If a provider is unavailable, UI can still fall back to Ollama when reachable.
- Chat history is local (`backend/data/chats.json`).
